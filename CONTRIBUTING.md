# ddd-hexagonal-cqrs-es-eda Contributor Guide

## Contributing
Thank you for your interest in contributing to Bitloops. We would love for you to contribute and help make it better! All contributions are welcome and we believe the process should be fun, enjoyable, and educational for anyone and everyone. 
Before you begin, please read our code of conduct and check existing issues. You can contribute with new issues, new docs as well as updates and tweaks, blog posts, and more.
 
## How to Start?
Firstly, we would like to invite you to our community. Join our slack group, introduce yourself and get to know the rest of the team. There is probably someone working on an issue that interests you, or has at least spent some time thinking about it. 
Reach out with questions via [Discord](https://discord.gg/cQcnRJQ256) or [@thebitloops](https://twitter.com/thebitloops) on Twitter. You can also add questions through [Bitloops' GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/bitloops/bitloops-language/discussions). If you prefer, you can also simply submit an [issue](https://github.com/bitloops/bitloops-language/issues), and a maintainer will guide you!
We strongly recommend filing an issue before working on non-trivial changes to the implementation. This lets us reach an agreement on your proposal before you put significant effort into it, and it has a much higher likelihood of being accepted.
 
### Code of Conduct
We want to keep Bitloops open and inclusive so please read and follow our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/bitloops/bitloops-language/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
 
### How to contribute?
We recommend baby steps so you can get familiar with our contribution process. We have a list of good first issues that contain bugs and have a relatively limited scope, and therefore a great place to start. 
If you decide to fix an issue, please be sure to check the comments in case somebody is already working on it. If there hasn’t been any activity, then leave a comment stating that you intend to work on it so other people don’t accidentally duplicate your effort.
If the issue has already been claimed by someone else, but there hasn’t been any recent activity, then feel free to take over after leaving a comment. 

We would also welcome any new issues you may find. We do suggest searching for the particular issue you would like to report in the existing issue list before reporting new ones. In addition, if you do encounter any vulnerability issues, please do follow our [Security Policy](https://github.com/bitloops/bitloops-language/blob/main/.github/SECURITY) instead of creating a new issue. 
 
### Create a Pull Request
After making your changes, open a pull request (PR). Submit your PR and other Bitloopers will review the PR with you. 
If you come across an issue, such as a merge conflict, or don't know how to open a pull request, then we suggest reading [GitHub's pull request tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests) on how to resolve merge conflicts and other issues. Finally, once your PR is merged, you will be proudly listed as a contributor in the contributor chart.
 
### Contributor License Agreement (CLA)
As an open-source programming language, Bitloops needs to obtain a contributor license agreement (CLA) from its contributors to ensure all users have access to the open source code. This process only needs to be conducted once as we will cross-check your GitHub username before accepting any PR. To complete the CLA please email us at contributor@bitloops.com and we’ll provide you with the necessary forms for online signature.  
 
### Introducing New Features
Our team wants to build the best possible version of Bitloops whilst remaining loyal to its vision and mission. At the same time we are thrilled if users want to also contribute to Bitloops and want to strike the best balance. 
Therefore, if you have ideas, please feel free to share them by opening an issue to explain and explore your ideas before introducing a new pull request. We’d love to learn from you as well as share some insights we may have. 
By doing this, Bitloops developers will be able to provide technical input, share best practices and further explain architecture or feature design patterns. This ensures the Bitloops community has sufficient discussion about new features, its value proposition and how it fits into the product roadmap. 
 
 
### Want to help in other ways?
We love PRs and appreciate all contributions, so if you want to help further, then we are your biggest fans! Below are several ways you could help Bitloops spread the joy of building software faster and better using domain-driven design principles and behavior-driven development principles:

### Content: Blogs, Podcasts, Social Media & Speaking
If you enjoy creating content and like using Bitloops, then we would actively encourage you to create blog posts, videos or social media posts about Bitloops or one of its features. Do mention @bitloops on twitter, linkedin or facebook and feel free to link to our own videos, tutorials or website. 
If you wish, email our team on hello@bitloops.com so we can give pointers and tips and help you spread the word by promoting your content on different Bitloops channels. 
 
### Giving Feedback & Reporting Bugs
Bitloops only makes sense if developers enjoy it and it solves problems. Please send any feedback through the email contributor@bitloops.com so we can better understand different use cases of Bitloops. Moreover, if you had any issue or came across any bugs, please let us know through the Slack Channel, GitHub issues or directly via email. 

### Submitting New Ideas
If you’d like to see a specific feature on Bitloops, then don’t hesitate to open an issue on our GitHub repository, providing as much information as possible. In turn, we will try to get more supporting feedback from the community and our own team to see if we can prioritize it. We’ll also get in touch directly with you to organize further discussions if convenient. 

### Improving Documentation
The Bitloops team is still small and the priorities are many. If you have any feedback on documentation, updates, designs, bug fixes or enhancements then please do not hesitate to submit and update. Any spelling, grammar or even translations are very much appreciated. 

### Meetups, Conferences and Universities
If you’re keen on improving your presenting skills and have signed up as a Speak for a Meetup, Conference or lecture at a university about your experience as a developer, then explaining what you’ve built with Bitloops could be an interesting option. Explaining the unique challenges and successes, how Bitloops supported you in developing high quality architecture can provide great speaking material. 
In fact, we would be happy to provide feedback on your talk and help you with some additional material. Please get in touch via contributor@bitloops.com!

### Help Someone Help Bitloops

Reach out to them or post an answer if you’re confident about it. You can also help by teaching others how to contribute to Bitloops repo!
